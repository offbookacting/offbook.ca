We aim to put every rehearsal method out there inside the app.

We'd love to discover new ways people use the app. It's a rehearsal tool, but it's also for: stand-up comedy, speeches, wedding speeches, wedding speeches where you don't like the groom, wedding speeches where you don't like the bride, rehearsing a conversation (à la "The Rehearsal") like the conversation where you tell your sister that you don't like her husband, or even drawing a picture of a dog.

                                    There will eventually be a clean, simple layout for recording self tapes and choosing takes using a simple UI.

                                    Open any web files in Off Book. Use web-based acting tools (International Dialects of English Archive for accent reference). Publish your self tape within the app. Save web bookmarks for easy access to frequently visited webpages. Download your script from Actors Access, Casting Network, etc. Download scripts from the internet. Files downloaded from the integrated browser will download right into the project folder and go immediately into the files sidebar. Procrastinate, right within the app.

                                    Some call the highlighter the "ego stick" because you should be approaching the script as an artist, who's a small part of a bigger picture. I call the highlighter "the thing that makes it easy to see my lines cause I get nervous when im acting and it gives me situational dyslexia". So highlight your lines automatically in the app, or manually if the software fights you.
